# NodeJS File System

I have created a server. \
https://nodejs-file-system-mma2.onrender.com/write -> endpoint allow user to add current date-time.txt file in the TextFile folder. \
The content of the file has current timeStamp(current time). \
https://nodejs-file-system-mma2.onrender.com/read -> endpoint allow user to read all date-time.text names  in the folder. \
I have used express for creating server and to read and write i used fs inbuild node.
